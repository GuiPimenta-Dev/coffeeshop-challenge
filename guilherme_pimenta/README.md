## Overall Assessment

### Passing Criteria
To pass this evaluation, a candidate must achieve at least **28 points out of 40** from the core sections.

If the minimum required score is not met, bonus points should be considered to determine if the candidate can still qualify.

### Final Decision

Total of Points: 27.5

- [ ] PASS (28+)
- [x] FAIL (< 28)

### Strengths
- Excellent code quality with clear separation of concerns and effective use of design patterns
- Strong project structure with logical organization and well-defined layers
- Good test coverage with comprehensive unit tests for critical functionality

### Areas for Improvement
- No implementation of resilience patterns (async processing and retry mechanisms)
- Missing API documentation and endpoint examples
- Needs to implement email notification printing for status transitions

### Final Comments

Guilherme has demonstrated strong software engineering fundamentals with a well-structured project that follows good design patterns and code organization principles. The application implements most of the core business requirements with good test coverage.

However, the solution falls just short of passing (27.5 vs 28 points required) primarily due to missing resilience features and incomplete implementation of status transition notifications. With some additional work on these areas, this could be a very strong submission.
