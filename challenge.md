# Project Overview

Welcome to the technical portion of our application process! Weâ€™re excited that you made it to this point and hope that you enjoy working on the upcoming Trio Challenge, a special take-home project that we designed to assess your technical maturity.

The Trio Challenge consists of creating a RESTful coffee shop order management application.

## Deliverables
- GitHub private repository with your solution.

## Instructions
1. Create a new empty private GitHub repository.
2. Develop and deliver a solution that is production-ready by opening a new PR in your repository.
3. Add `challenge@trio.dev` as a collaborator.
4. Record a video with your screen and camera walking through your solution.
5. Submit your project by answering all fields on [challenge.trio.dev](https://challenge.trio.dev).

You will have **7 days** to complete the project and return it. If you have any questions or are not sure about something, please contact `challenge@trio.dev`.

## Getting Started

This application needs to support two types of users: **Managers** and **Customers**. Each role has different permissions and responsibilities:

- **Managers** have full access to all features.
- **Customers** have limited access and cannot perform managerial actions.

To simulate role-based access, requests should include a `role` header with one of the following values:

```
role: customer
role: manager
```

ðŸ”¹ **Note:** Authentication is not required for this challenge, only the role header is needed to differentiate users.


### **Managers**
Managers are responsible for overseeing order processing and ensuring smooth operations. Their main tasks include to change the status of an order:

- Orders can have one of five statuses: **Waiting, Preparation, Ready, Delivered, and Canceled**.
- Status transitions must follow one of this strict sequence:
  - **Waiting** â†’ **Preparation** â†’ **Ready** â†’ **Delivered**

### Customers:
- Order and customize their orders with several options from the catalog below.
- A customer can cancel its own order if the order has status `Waiting`.
 - **Waiting** â†’ **Canceled** 

## Catalog with Pricing

| Product        | Base Price | Variation       | Price Change |
|---------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Latte**     | $4.00      | Pumpkin Spice  | +$0.50       |
|               |            | Vanilla        | +$0.30       |
|               |            | Hazelnut       | +$0.40       |
| **Espresso**  | $2.50      | Single Shot    | +$0.00       |
|               |            | Double Shot    | +$1.00       |
| **Macchiato** | $4.00      | Caramel        | +$0.50       |
|               |            | Vanilla        | +$0.30       |
| **Iced Coffee** | $3.50    | Regular        | +$0.00       |
|               |            | Sweetened      | +$0.30       |
|               |            | Extra Ice      | +$0.20       |
| **Donuts**     | $2.00      | Glazed         | +$0.00       |
|               |            | Jelly          | +$0.30       |
|               |            | Boston Cream   | +$0.50       |

## Tasks

Create the following **REST API endpoints**.
Any customer should be able to consume them using a **secure way**:

- **View Menu** (list of products with pricing)
- **Place a new order** (calculate the total price based on variations and process payment)
  - When placing an order, payment must be processed using the payment mock service:
  ```http
  GET https://challenge.trio.dev/api/v1/payment?amount={TOTAL_AMOUNT}
  ```
  - The response from the payment mock service should be logged to the terminal
  - Orders should only be created if payment is successful

- **View order details** (product list, pricing & order status)

- **Update Orders Status** (the response from the email mock service should be logged to the terminal)
- Customers must receive an email notification whenever their order status changes. To simulate this, use the following notification mock service:  

  ```http
  GET https://challenge.trio.dev/api/v1/notify?status={ORDER_STATUS}
  ```

  **Example:** Sending a notification for an order in the `Waiting` status:  
  [https://challenge.trio.dev/api/v1/notify?status=waiting](https://trio.challenge.com/api/v1/notify?status=waiting)  

  - The response from the notification mock service should be logged to the terminal

- **Cancel Orders** (only if it has `Waiting` status)

# Evaluation

Present your solution using the framework of your choice, justifying your selection. During the evaluation, we will discuss any missing aspects.

## What will be evaluated

- **Documentation**: Clear README with project description, setup instructions, and API documentation
- **Code Quality**: Small, focused functions with clear responsibilities and separation of business logic
- **Architecture**: Logical project structure with proper separation of layers and effective design patterns
- **Implementation**: Correct API endpoints with proper RESTful principles and status codes
- **Business Logic**: Accurate order processing, price calculations, and role-based authorization
- **Resilience**: Asynchronous processing and retry mechanisms for external service calls
- **Security**: Input validation and appropriate error handling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests

## **What will be a differencial**

- Use of Docker for environment consistency.
- Implementation of design patterns for maintainable architecture.  
- Justification of design and implementation choices.  
- Proper component decoupling for modularity and flexibility.  

## **Use of AI in Development**  

We have no issue with the use of AI to assist in developmentâ€”after all, itâ€™s a tool we all use daily.  
However, what truly matters is your ability to **justify your decisions** and explain your reasoning.  

**Feel free to leave comments in your code explaining your thought process and the rationale behind your choices.**  

### **Examples:**  

```python
# Given the simplicity of this test case, I chose to use X, Y, and Z.  
# However, in a production environment, A, B, or C might be a better choice.  

# This class is a simplified representation of X, Y, and Z.  
# In a production setting, we could consider a more robust approach, such as A, B, or C.
