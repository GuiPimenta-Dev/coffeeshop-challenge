# Project Overview

Welcome to the technical portion of our application process! Weâ€™re excited that you made it to this point and hope that you enjoy working on the upcoming Trio Challenge, a special take-home project that we designed to assess your technical maturity.

The Trio Challenge consists of creating a RESTful coffee shop order management application.

## Deliverables
- GitHub private repository with your solution.

## Instructions
1. Create a new empty private GitHub repository.
2. Develop and deliver a solution that is production-ready by opening a new PR in your repository.
3. Add `challenge@trio.dev` as a collaborator.
4. Record a video with your screen and camera walking through your solution.
5. Submit your project by answering all fields on [challenge.trio.dev](https://challenge.trio.dev).

You will have **7 days** to complete the project and return it. If you have any questions or are not sure about something, please contact `challenge@trio.dev`.

## Getting Started

This application needs to support two types of users: **Managers** and **Customers**. Each role has different permissions and responsibilities:

- **Managers** have full access to all features.
- **Customers** have limited access and cannot perform managerial actions.

To simulate role-based access, requests should include a `role` header with one of the following values:

```
role: customer
role: manager
```

ðŸ”¹ **Note:** Authentication is not required for this challenge, only the role header is needed to differentiate users.


### **Managers**
Managers are responsible for overseeing order processing and ensuring smooth operations. Their main tasks include to change the status of an order:

- Orders can have one of the four statuses: **Waiting, Preparation, Ready, and Delivered**.
- Status transitions must follow one of this strict sequence:
  - **Waiting** â†’ **Preparation** â†’ **Ready** â†’ **Delivered**

### Customers:
- Order and customize their orders with several options from the catalog below.

## Catalog with Pricing

| Product        | Base Price | Variation       | Price Change |
|---------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Latte**     | $4.00      | Pumpkin Spice  | +$0.50       |
|               |            | Vanilla        | +$0.30       |
|               |            | Hazelnut       | +$0.40       |
| **Espresso**  | $2.50      | Single Shot    | +$0.00       |
|               |            | Double Shot    | +$1.00       |
| **Macchiato** | $4.00      | Caramel        | +$0.50       |
|               |            | Vanilla        | +$0.30       |
| **Iced Coffee** | $3.50    | Regular        | +$0.00       |
|               |            | Sweetened      | +$0.30       |
|               |            | Extra Ice      | +$0.20       |
| **Donuts**     | $2.00      | Glazed         | +$0.00       |
|               |            | Jelly          | +$0.30       |
|               |            | Boston Cream   | +$0.50       |

## Tasks

Your assignment is to build a complete, production-ready REST API for a coffee shop order management system. The application must include integration with external mock services to simulate real-world scenarios. Below are the detailed requirements for each endpoint:

### Required Endpoints

1. **View Menu** (`GET /menu`)
   - Must return a complete list of products with their base prices and all available variations
   - Response must include pricing details for each variation as shown in the catalog

2. **Place a New Order** (`POST /orders`)
   - Must accept a list of products with the variations
   - Must calculate the total price correctly based on base prices and variations
   - **Critical Requirement:** Integrate with the payment processing mock service
     ```http
     POST https://challenge.trio.dev/api/v1/payment?amount={TOTAL_AMOUNT}
     ```
   - Must display the complete payment service response in the terminal
   - Orders should ONLY be created if the payment service returns a successful response
   - All new orders must be created with the initial status of `Waiting`
   - The API should return appropriate error messages if payment fails

3. **View Order Details** (`GET /orders/{id}`)
   - Must return complete order information including:
     - All ordered items with their variations
     - Individual and total pricing
     - Current order status
     - Order creation timestamp

4. **Update Order Status** (`PATCH /orders/{id}/status`)
   - **Manager Only:** Endpoint must enforce role-based access (only managers can update status)
   - Must validate that status transitions follow the allowed sequence:
     - **Waiting** â†’ **Preparation** â†’ **Ready** â†’ **Delivered**
   - **Critical Requirement:** Must integrate with the notification mock service after every successful status update
     ```http
     POST https://challenge.trio.dev/api/v1/notify?status={ORDER_STATUS}
     ```
   - Must display the complete notification service response in the terminal

# Evaluation

Present your solution using the language/framework of your choice, justifying your selection. 

What truly matters to us is your ability to analyze situations critically, justify your decisions, and clearly explain your reasoning.

**Feel free to leave comments in your code explaining your thought process and the rationale behind your choices.**  

### **Examples:**  

```python
# Given the simplicity of the use case, I chose to use X, Y, and Z.  
# However, in a production environment, A, B, or C might be a better choice.  

# This class is a simplified representation of X, Y, and Z.  
# In a production setting, we could consider a more robust approach, such as A, B, or C. 
```
